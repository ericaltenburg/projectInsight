STIR: Screen Time for Instagram Reducer

I spend too much time on Instagram mindlessly refreshing my feed to get my little dopamine fix. Usually, the go-to solution for this is to delete the app altogether, but I have a severe case of FOMO (fear of missing out) so I would still like to periodically check up on my friends and family; additionally, by not deleting it I can exercise my discipline.

After giving it some thought, I determined the best course of action to fix this would be to have something evaluate and predict my daily usage for my apps, and depending on the apps I want to limit, I can look at the predicted time and say to myself, "yeah, I'm not gonna do that." 

A classic case of: because you told me what to do, I'm not going to do it.

Sure, there might be better ways of doing this, but I have a tendency to make things very complicated so why stop now :) Plus, I get to code more things as a result.

Let's see if this works! I'll try and compile my future screen-times in a nice little graph that's easy on the eyes.
